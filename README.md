# ECE241-Digital-System
lab work for the verilog course called ECE241

I used this ARM chip Intel FPGA board to test my code to complete all these Verilog coding assginments.
This board is the one in the picture below:

The screenshot below is using the ModelSim program to looking into the detail about when is happening. And I used the sginal shown from ModelSim to compare with the LEDR light displayed on this Intel FPGA board to learn and complete some of the assignments.
